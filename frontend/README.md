# Arachne 4 Frontend   
  
## tl;dr
Use the following command to get your local instance of the Arachne 4 Frontend running after checking out this repository:
```bash
npm install && npm run build && npm start
```

## Development

The repository includes a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) configuration for setting up a local server, preconfigured with:
* proxying to the backend running on the development server
* url rewriting for AngularJS' HTML5 mode
* live reloading

### Prerequisites

You need the following components in order for the local server to work:
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

To install the necessary dependencies for the app run the following command in the working directory:
```bash
npm install
```

### Deployment

Build the application by running

```bash
npm run build
```

### con10t submodule

The static files representing the project pages are stored in the directory `con10t`.

The con10t submodule provides many valuable widgets which can be used on project pages. You can find a demonstration of the widgets at https://arachne.dainst.org/project/widgetsdemo.

### Configuring the Development Server

The Arachne 4 Frontend uses the development server configured in the config file template "dev-config.json.template" in the folder "/config".
  
Change the template if you want to use another server than the default development server.

When running "npm run build", the template file "/config/dev-config.json.template" get's initially copied to "/config/dev-config.json".

In each run of "npm run build", the script checks if "dev-config.js" exists. If it doesn't exist, the template file will be copied and renamed to "dev-config.js". If "dev-config.js" already exists, the file won't be overwritten.

### Running the development server

In order to run the frontend in the development server use the following command after building the Arachne 4 Frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

After that you should be able to access the frontend under [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

Any changes made to HTML, SCSS or JS files automatically trigger a browser reload.

### Running the tests

To run the unit tests, call

```bash
npm test
```

This will run all tests matching the filename pattern `test/*_spec.js`. Jasmine is used as the testing framework here.

Call

```bash
export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8" && npm run e2e
```

to run the e2e tests matching the filename pattern `e2e/*.spec.js`. Precondition for this to work is that you have the `dist` dir that gets served at `localhost:8080` by defai√∂t, as is the case when you run `npm start`.
