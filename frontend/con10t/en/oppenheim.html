            </p><em>Max
            Freiherr von Oppenheim</em> (1860-1946) was not only a famous explorer
            but also a well known diplomat and collector of oriental artifacts. As
            an employee of the German consulate general in Cairo, he observed the Arabian
            world and excavated Tell Halaf in Syria. In his many expeditions, most
            taking several years, he explored the region between the Levante and Mesopotamia.
            <p>Oppenheim was always accompanied by professional photographers. The Near
                East and its people as well as its nature and architecture kept him mesmerized
                for decades. The result was a collection of <em>13.000 photos</em>
                that captured
                the life and culture of a world gone by.</p>
            <p>Max von Oppenheim's literary contributions and the photo-collection are
                in the ownership of the <a href="https://arachne.dainst.org/project/rwwa">Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Wirtschaftarchiv (Rhine-Westphalian Economy Archive)</a>
