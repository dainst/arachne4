                    Classical Archaeology in Munich</a> is home to a vast collection of photography. Starting
                in 2016 digitization of this collection has been underway, with the results made open to the public
                via the Arachne database. The photo negatives, photoprints , photo cards, glass plates and large-format
                slides can themselves be viewed in the photo archive (Fotothek) of the Institute of Classical
                Archaeology.
            </p>
            <p>
                The photo archive today houses more than 100,000 pictures and is officially part of the Museum of
                plaster casts (Museum für Abgüsse München, MfA). The establishment of the photography collection dates
                back to the initiative of the archaeologist <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Brunn"
                                                               target="_blank">Heinrich Brunn</a>. When he accepted the
                the position of Department Chair in 1865, he had two conditions: the founding of an archaeological
                seminar as well as a collection of plaster casts with an accompanying body of photography. The first
                picture dates back to
                1871. It shows relief and statue fragments and parts of the architectural ornamentation from the <a

                </con10t-image>
                In the beginning Heinrich Brunn set up the archive in his private apartment. For the first couple of
                years students could access the photos here, until both the collection of photography and the plaster
                casts were moved to the ground floor of the Hofarkaden on Galeriestraße 4 in Munich.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the initial phase the archive counted merely 120 pictures. Only towards the end of the 19th
                century did the inventory increase substantially. In the year 1894 alone almost 200 photos were added.
                In addition to this Heinrich Brunn bequeathed 4,555 pictures to the institute once he passed. Another
                6,500 were added under his successor <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Furtwängler"
                                                        target="_blank">Adolf Furtwängler</a>. By 1929 the archive had
                expanded from 17,300 to
                28,300 photos. <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hauser" target="_blank">Friedrich
                Hauser's</a> collection was especially important. In 1917 he gifted all of his
                private books and photos to the institute.
            </p>
            <p>
                An air strike in WWII destroyed many plaster casts and a small fraction of the photo archive. The rate
                at which new pictures were being acquired slowed down substantially during the war and finally came to a
                halt in 1943. Only in 1948 did the collection again start to grow. A year later the Institute for
                Classical Archaeology moved together with all the photos into the old administrative building of the
                National Socialist Party on Königsplatz, which today is known as the <a
                    href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Münchner_Haus_der_Kulturinstitute"
                    target="_blank">Haus der Kulturinstitute</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                By the early years after the war the institute was in possession of close to 46,000 pictures. This
                includes numerous collected editions of photography such as <a
                    href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/books/EinzelaufnahmenSculpturen1895" target="_blank">"Photographische
                Einzelaufnahmen antiker Sculpturen" by P. Arndt und W. Amelung</a>, which had been purchased between
                1888 and 1947. In 1986 the
                archive was reorganized by <a
                    href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pfanner" target="_blank">Michael Pfanner</a>. The old
                inventory system was replaced by one following the
                example of the <a

                During the 1980’s and 1990’s photos from other institutes and museums were systematically purchased. In
                addition a number of gifted collections were added, among them ca. 200 pictures by the photographer

                Bavarian Academy of Sciences for the study of ancient urbanism</a> has been on permanent loan since the
                1990’s. One of the largest additions is <a

                photos of ancient portraits. It was
                donated in 2013 and is currently being digitized by student assistants.

            <p>Arachne allows one to browse for individual pictures belonging to the Munich collections as well as the
                ancient objects, buildings etc. that are depicted on said photos. The negative numbers are comprised of
                a number ranging from 1 to 76166 and, for photos acquired after 1986, of the year, e.g. 86/123. The
                abbreviation FM (Fotothek München) is included to indicate the location of the negative. The negative
                numbers for the three main groupings of photography are as follows:</p>
