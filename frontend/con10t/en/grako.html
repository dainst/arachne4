            Craft production was a key element of pre-modern economies, the workshop acting as an important point of
            intersection between exploitation and daily use of resources (e.g. clay/pottery, stone/architectural
            elements, iron ore/tools). Within the framework of the Research Training Group 1878 »Archaeology of
            pre-modern economies« funded by the DFG, it is aimed to compile craft production sites attested by
            archaeological material as exhaustively as possible. This data base is accessible for free all over the
            world, thus providing an important foundation for further scientific questions and projects as well as an
            overview on essential aspects of the economic and daily life in pre-modern societies for the broader public.

            <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">Methodology</h2>

            <p>
                All craft production sites included in this project are attested by archaeological finds and/or
                features. The most important information provided in the relevant publications is recorded in the
                specifically adapted framework of the object data base ARACHNE using a standardised vocabulary to
                facilitate search queries, comparisons and analyses on a big scale. Since the publications themselves
                are dispersed, heterogeneous, and often hard to access, this consistent data base should facilitate and
                accelerate research on thematically, chronologically or geographically comprehensive questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The workshops are contextualised with various technical resources of the German Archaeological Institute
                and the Cologne Digital Archaeology Laboratory to provide additional information for example on relevant
                locations, bibliographic references, deposits of raw material and transport routes. Although the project
                focusses on the Mediterranean in greco-Roman antiquity, it comprises also other cultural regions and
                eras (from Mesoamerica to China, from Palaeolithic to the Middle Ages). Data on further workshops (also
                from other epochs and regions) is added continuously.</p>

                <con10t-catalog-tree catalog-id="92" style="width:80%" float:left=""></con10t-catalog-tree>

            <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">Instructions for use</h2>

            <p>
                The entries are created as object data sets in ARACHNE and arranged to a catalogue according to the
                materials processed at the sites. Clicking on a folder symbol shows possible subfolders or data sets on
                the individual workshops, which can be accessed directly to get detailed information on each site.
                Besides, you can show all data sets within one folder by clicking on the magnifying glass on the right.
                The search results can be further filtered according to various criteria (e.g. image(s) available or
                not, location, publications). Furthermore, you may search for specific terms within the project’s data
                sets, show all entries or use the cartographic search for all georeferenced records of craft production
                sites.
