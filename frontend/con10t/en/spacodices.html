  <p>The digital catalog of illuminated manuscripts of medieval Spain is based
  on an inventory of about 4,500 colored small image slides, located in the
  <a href=

  Madrid Department of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI)</a>. The
  collection was compiled between 1962 to 1965 on the initiative of the
  director and art historian Helmut Schlunk, who had a great interest in the
  early medieval art of Spain. Otto Karl Werckmeister at that time employed as
  a research assistant at the DAI Madrid was responsible for the collection's
  composition. Werckmeister and Detlef Noack, photographer of the Institute
  Madrid, visited libraries and archives in Spain, England, France and the
  United States. From this collaboration a number of Werckmeister's
  publications were emerged, and until this day the Spanish illuminated
  manuscripts remain one of his fields of research ( <i>Die Bilder der drei
  Propheten in der Biblia Hispalense</i> , in: Madrid Releases 4 [1963],
  141-188; <i>The image of the "jugglers" in the Beatus of Silos</i> , in:
  Reading medieval images, 2002, 128-139).</p>

  <p>On site, a special focus was laid on the visual presentation of the
  manuscripts (miniatures, initials), which is why the collection offers a
  variety of close-ups. Thus, the project did not aim to replicate the medieval
  codex in its multi-media diversity. Nevertheless, every single page was
  completely preserved photographically. Furthermore, hybrid forms such as
  visual mazes of letters or diagrams were regarded, which has become a focal
  point of interest in art history. Altogether reproductions of 36 illuminated
  manuscripts of different text categories have been collected. One focal point
  was the Apocalypse comments of Beatus of Liéebana represented in 11
  codices.</p>

  <p>Until this day the collection is presumed to be unique. Firstly, because
  some of the considered manuscripts are still accessible only through the
  original or in parts through facsimiles. Secondly, the collection offers the
  chance to reveal coherently the Spanish illuminations of the early and high
  Middle Ages in their artistic diversity and in their various text and book
  types. In addition, this collection is also interesting in the perspective of
  the history of the discipline, since it provides a basis for discussions
  about the early approach to the medieval illuminations in general and the
  Spanish illumination in particular.</p>

  <p>The image slides of illuminated manuscripts are available via the
  Arachne-Bookbrowser's TEI-Viewer. As a viewing tool the TEI-Viewer reproduces
  the location of the miniatures and initials in the book body and their
  relation to the texts. The image material was also supplemented by a series
  of general information complementing the manuscript. The TEI-Viewer thus
  enables an overview of the physical appearance and the visual presentation of
  the respective Codex. Creating connections between the manuscripts TEI-Viewer
  invites to interdisciplinary questions.</p>

  <p><em>In the ARACHNE-VIEWER and in the TEI-VIEWER, which offers a more
  detailed object description, the following Codices are gradually
  available:</em></p>
