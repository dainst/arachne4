            <p>Based on their tradition in research, the <a
                    href="http://www.dainst.org/en/projekt/-/project-display/81139?"
                    target="_blank">DAI</a> holds the largest and oldest stocks of images worldwide
                within the field of archaeology of the Mediterranean countries. These images
                are digitized and made accessible in a long-term plan, by the database
                Arachne, which is run by the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) and
                the <a href="http://archaeologie.uni-koeln.de/node/23" target="_blank">CoDArchLab</a>.
                Especially the oldest and historical most invaluable images are threatened
                by physical decomposition and destruction because of environmental influences,
                natural catastrophes like earthquakes and in the long run, manual use.
                Today's scientists have to research collections of each DAI's photo archive
                in person, which leads to gradual wear marks on the original material even
                upon careful handling. By that, even in the best case, the basic material
                is charged. Besides these problems of conservation, the deficit of development
                is obvious within the information, which is included in the negative holdings.
                The structuring schemes of the photo libraries cannot replace a structured
                subject indexing. The potential of the glass negatives, belonging to the
                DAI has to regarded, not only as threatened, but also as lying fallow.</p>
            <p>The project started in 2006 by editing the glass negatives from the departments
                of the German Archaeological Institute in Athens, Istanbul and Cairo (Emagines1).
                In 2008 a second project phase continued the work, by dealing with the
                negatives from Rome, Madrid, the headquarters in Berlin and the Eurasia-Department
                (Emagines2). Subject of the third phase of this project, which is funded
                by the DFG, were about 60,000 more glass negatives, which are threatened
                immediately by physical degradation. These negatives are situated in the
                departments of the German Archaeological Institute in Athens, Berlin and
                Rome. Besides the pure digitization and development of these negatives,
                the project aims the improve of integration in the semantic web by extending
                the CRM- implementation in Arachne and the integration in other web resources
                like <a href="http://www.europeana.eu" target="_blank">Europeana</a>,
                <a
                        href="http://www.clarosnet.org" target="_blank">Claros</a>and <a
                        href="http://www.ariadne-infrastructure.eu" target="_blank">Ariadne</a>.
                The installation of an open-access-area for all of the scans within the
                project and the implementation of the Creative-Commons-License were new
                aims of the third project phase. By the programming of a module for image
                and object identification, every image should come to be clear and permanently
                citable. Furthermore a multilingual user-surface should be created. Within
                the third phase of the project all of the above cited aims were completed
                to the full extent.</p>
            <p>The negatives mostly contain historical images of sculpture, topography
                and architecture, much of which no longer exists in its former condition.
                The holding is qualitative and quantitative a unique stock, even international
                compared to the Mediterranean countries. The aim is a permanent digital
                conservation of the information of the glass negatives and the database
                related development on the internet via Arachne. To avoid exposing the
                fragile contents from the risks of long-distance transport, the images
                are being scanned in the departments of the German Archaeological Institute
                (DAI) in an on-going process. The scanned images are then sent to the CoDArchLab
                for digital processing, entry into a database and long-term storage on
                the SAN of the University of Cologne for the DAI. The resulting documentation-complex
                is a centralised scientific of the DAI which can be accessed by web.</p>
            <p>As of now, upon completion of the works mentioned above, approximately
                150.000 glass negatives are available in Arachne. A fuzzy meta search for
                'D-DAI-ATH', 'D-DAI-IST', 'D-DAI-ROM', 'D-DAI-EUR', 'D-DAI-Z', 'D-DAI-MAD'
                and 'D-DAI-KAI' leads to an overview of more than 60.000 object records
                of different categories, to which the glass negatives are referred. The
                glass negatives can be referenced through about 150.000 records using image-navigation.</p>
