  <p>The Basilica Aemilia, the subject of this study, consists of a basilica
  fronted by a portico and shops. Its location, scale, and decorative elements
  make it one of the most important surviving structures of the ancient city of
  Rome. In comparison with most other ancient buildings, especially in the
  Forum Romanum, it is particularly well preserved, and therefore of special
  scholarly importance. Yet historically it is an understudied building, and
  the little work which has taken place has barely been published.</p>

  <p>The present study has identified and documented the majority of the
  surviving ornamental architectural fragments from the Imperial phase of the
  Basilica Aemilia. The aim has been to form a complete picture of the
  available evidence, and this has made it possible to understand the building
  in unprecedented detail. Due to the complexity of the evidence from the Forum
  Romanum, a special method was developed to create a critical catalogue of the
  core material. The architectural elements that form the basis for this study
  were divided into discrete series of fragments that certainly, probably, or
  only possibly belonged to the building, so as to avoid premature conclusions
  in the interpretation of the evidence.</p>

  <p>To begin with, the objective was to analyse the ornamentation of
  individual architectural elements according to their technical
  characteristics, placement and workmanship thus to draw conclusions as to the
  reconstruction, chronology, and construction history of the building complex
  as a whole.</p>

  <p>The Basilica consisted of a nave with a surrounding aisle and an
  additional, narrower aisle on the north side. It was defined by an outer wall
  and had at least two storeys supported by columns. The ground floor colonnade
  employed the Ionic order, while the Corinthian order was used for the upper
  storey. The interaxials of the upper colonnade were narrower, by a factor of
  three quarters, than those on the ground floor. On the lower floor the walls
  were faced in marble and decorated with no more than an architrave, in
  contrast with the rich interior decoration of the upper storey, where the
  walls were adorned with bases, pilasters, and capitals, and an entablature
  protruding above the pilasters. On each floor several sets of functionally
  equivalent but iconographically distinct structural elements were used; these
  sets can be assigned to different parts of the building.</p>

  <p>The portico overlooking the open space of the Forum had a single storey
  and was crowned by a protruding attic. The façade was defined by arches
  supported by piers which incorporated superimposed half-columns. The ends of
  the portico were enclosed by walls, though at the west end there were doors
  which pierced the wall. The east end of the portico was defined by a
  protruding façade which perhaps merged with an arch spanning the Via Sacra.
  The portico had a hybrid order featuring Doric, Tuscan, and Ionic elements.
  The same pattern was repeated, with the exception of the console, in the
  interior space of the portico as panelled wall decoration, although the
  constituent elements of the interior entablature were compressed in
  comparison with the exterior façade.</p>

  <p>Whether the surviving rinceaux, piers and capitals formed a separate
  storey of piers between the upper and lower storeys of the basilica, as
  Heinrich Bauer has proposed, or whether they should instead be assigned to a
  pergola on the roof of the portico, cannot be determined with any absolute
  certainty. On the basis of the available evidence, however, it does seem that
  the hypothesis of an intermediate storey is the more plausible. The oriental
  statues probably stood on the protruding entablature of the lower order in
  the nave of the basilica. In the case of the remaining architectural
  fragments – of pilasters, decorative shields (clipei), and coffered ceilings
  – examined in this study, it is not possible to determine whether they should
  be assigned to the building or not.</p>

  <p>The entire building complex, as it now appears in the ground plan which
  survives to this day in the Forum, was built in a single construction phase
  in the Augustan period. This dating is based on an inscription honouring
  Lucius Caesar set up between 2 B.C. and A.D. 14. There is also a probable
  connection between the archaeological remains and a reference in Cassius Dio
  which states that the building had to be rebuilt after a fire in 14 B.C.</p>

  <p>The architectural remains attributable to this phase reveal an extreme
  variation in the typology and workmanship of the individual decorative
  elements; from this it is clear that to date the architectural ornamentation
  on the basis of typology and style, with the aim of establishing a chronology
  that is accurate to within a few years, is fundamentally impossible. It is
  rather the case that forms which have generally been labelled as Early
  Augustan appear to date from the same period as others which have until now
  been understood to be Late Augustan or Tiberian.</p>

  <p>Imperial period interventions which entailed the production of new
  architectural elements can be found in two parts of the complex. The first
  intervention took place in the latter 1st century A.D., probably in the time
  of Nero or Vespasian; this involved the replacement of several architectural
  elements – bases, columns, capitals and architrave blocks – in the eastern
  section of the long colonnade on the north side of the basilica on the ground
  floor. This was probably a controlled restoration carried out without
  dismantling the building as a whole. Possibly this took place in relation to
  the construction of the Templum Pacis, which adjoins the building on the
  north side. The second intervention involved the replacement of a metope on
  the Doric frieze belonging to the façade of the portico facing the Forum. The
  scale of this intervention cannot be determined with any certainty, but on
  the evidence of the surviving architectural fragments it is best to assume
  only minor repairs. This work likewise took place in the latter 1st century
  A.D., perhaps at the same time as the renovation of the basilica. Aside from
  what has just been mentioned, no further Imperial period reconstruction
  measures can be identified on the basis of the material evidence. Not until
  the time of the tetrarchs are major restorations again attested, in the form
  of brick walls. The hypothesis that there were repairs resulting from a
  catastrophe in the Forum which is known from the literary sources and which
  occurred at some point between the Augustan and tetrarchal periods finds no
  confirmation in the archaeology.</p>

  <p>In this study of the Basilica Aemilia it has proven possible to
  differentiate the ornamentation of the original Augustan plan from decorative
  elements developed by the workmen during the course of construction. Detailed
  analysis of the surviving fragments allowed conclusions to be drawn in
  relation to the planning and construction process. Thus it was possible to
  distinguish between different groups of stonemasons who undertook varying
  degrees of preparatory work on the individual, made-to-order building blocks
  which were laid out on the ground, or put the finishing touches on the
  ornamentation once the blocks had been set in place. Posting groups of
  workers to pre-determined areas of the building or individual masons to
  particular sections made it possible to calculate and evaluate workers’
  performance. As with many other Roman buildings the original plan was
  frequently modified during construction.</p>

  <p>On the basis of numerous observations it has also been possible to show
  that the selection and placement of the various decorative bands were planned
  in detail and imposed on the masons as part of a binding blueprint. Yet there
  often were no specific instructions as to the details of iconography or the
  finishing of the decorative elements. Apparently, the decision to craft the
  ornamentation in a generally uniform manner, as with the upper floor of the
  basilica, or less so, as with the basilica’s lower storey, rested with the
  craftsmen or groups of craftsmen who carried out the work.</p>

  <p>The iconography of Augustan building blocks was the model for the
  ornamentation of blocks added as part of subsequent interventions. There is
  remarkably little variation in the details of the iconography. Significant
  differences are only visible in the standard of execution.</p>

  <p>Using the reconstruction and findings relating both to the chronology and
  to the planning and construction process of the building complex, it was
  possible to pose questions relating to the use and meaning of the
  architectural decoration. Although it is impossible to appreciate the full
  spatial impact of the building as it existed in antiquity, nevertheless is it
  clear that the decoration was used to mark out different areas of
  representational space within the building. Several strategies were used, for
  example the conscious use of different materials or variation in the volume
  of ornamentation, which in places was specially worked to take account of the
  view from below. One purpose of all this was to invite the viewer to
  contemplate the function of the building in conjunction with its decorative
  splendour, and in this there can be no doubt that the highlight of the
  complex was the basilica’s central nave. In addition it would seem that
  efforts were made to integrate the basilica and portico with their respective
  and different urban settings. In order to do this, the decorative forms used
  on the portico and basilica were designed according to differing conceptual
  frameworks. The architecture of the portico was defined by arches and
  archaizing forms; it was embedded in the Forum, enhanced its uniform
  monumentality, and underlined its dignitas. The basilica was an enclosed and
  self-contained space, a theatrical stage for the display of contemporary
  decorative forms and innovations in architectural design.</p>
