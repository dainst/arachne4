         <h3>History</h3>

        <p>The Institute's collection of photographs dates back to the invention
            of photography itself. After the death of Walther Amelung in1927, the Institute
            inherited the collection that he had acquired for his own research purposes.
            From 1928 onwards, his successor, Ludwig Curtius, proceeded to systematically
            organize and expand the photo archive, thus giving it its current form.
            In the early 1930s, the Institute acquired a laboratory and established
            the post of an in-house photographer. As a result, the collection has grown
            considerably and extensive photo campaigns have given it varying content.
            Today the Roman photo archive is a unique research tool in archaeology.</p>
        
<h3>Inventory and Focus</h3>

        <p>The photo archive consists of roughly 280,000 black-and-white photographs
            of which 200,000 are available as negatives. The collection is arranged
            according to the main categories within classical archaeological research:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ideal sculpture</b> (deities; mythological figures; non-mythological
                statues; animals; mythical creatures/chimeras)</li>
            <li><b>Portrait sculpture</b> (Greek; Etruscan-Italic; Roman)</li>
            <li><b>Sarcophagi</b> (Greek; Etruscan; Republican-Early Imperial; Imperial;

            <li><b>Mosaics</b> (focus on: Italy; Roman provinces)</li>
            <li><b>Topography</b> (Greece; Italy; selected Roman provinces)</li>
            <li><b>Vases</b> (Proto-geometric; Geometric; Proto-Corinthian; Corinthian;
                Eastern Greek; Western Greek; Lakonian; Chalcidian; Boeotian; Attic; Italic-Etruscan;
                South Italian; Hellenistic; Roman)</li>
            <li><b>Terracotta</b> (focus on Italy: figurative, architectural)</li>

<h4>Information about the identity numbers of the negatives</h4>

        <p>All negatives of the institute feature a negative number, i.e. inventory
            number composed of a four-digit date (year of the inventory, not the shot)
            and a continuous four-digit number. The abbreviation D-DAI Rom prior to
            the altogether eight-digit number brands the negative as belonging to the
            photo archive of the DAI Rome.</p>
        <p>Therefore the negative numbers are stated as follows:
            <br>Bsp.: D-DAI-ROM-1938.1329; D-DAI-ROM-2007.0023</p>
        <p>Negatives <strong>without</strong> date are part of the stock existing prior
            to 1928, e.g. D-DAI-ROM-00013).</p>
        <p>Within the stock of the photo archive are also negative numbers with inserted
            letter codes marking special groups of pictures within the collection (e.g.
            estates or bigger projects with regard to content).</p>
        <p>Following groups are currently available in iDAI.Images:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>D-DAI-ROM-<b>W</b>.93= Tatianer Warscher, topographical photographs of
                Pompeii (unstructured stock)</li>
            <li>D-DAI-ROM-96.<b>Vat</b>.1365= Vatican-project, collection of antique sculpture
                (structured and unstructured stock)</li>
            <li>D-DAI-ROM-<b>RA</b>-00322= Estate Friedrich Rakob (structured stock)</li>
        </ul>
        
<h4><a con10t-search-query="D-DAI-ROM">iDAI.Images – DAI Rome photo archive – Structured stock </a></h4>

        <p>Within the structured stock of iDAI.Images Arachne most of the currently
            digitized pictures of the photo archive of the DAI Rome are structured
            by objects. Apart from the ordinary search via the meta search engine,
            the welcome page offers the possibility to search via the extended search
            in order to immediately browse the desired object class. Alternatively
            one can search for the negative number of a picture via the meta search
            engine (e.g. D-DAI-ROM-89.746 (old label) or D-DAI-ROM-1961.0629 (new label)).</p>

        <p>Since May 2009, the growing digital stock of the photo archive of the
            DAI Rome is being managed via the unstructured stock of iDAI.Images Arachne.
            These images can be found by using the meta search engine on the welcome
            page of iDAI.Images Arachne. The extended search engine leads to the unstructured
            stock as well. This function offers direct access to the existing file
            structure in sorting the pictures chronologically by year.</p>
        <p>The picture files are to be continuously transferred to the structured
            stock, i.e. the object based iDAI.Images Arachne, within the following
            years.</p>
        
<h4>iDAI.Images – Sculpture  negatives</h4>

        <p>Via iDAI.Images Arachne you reach the digitized sculpture negatives which
            focus on the Roman photo archive. The complete stock up to and including
            1991 is available.</p>

            Mediterranean area.</p>
        
<h4><a con10t-page="traianssaeule">Monumentbrowser – Trajan´s Column</a></h4>

        <p>Among the monument browsers of iDAI.Images Arachne there is the so-called
            browser of Trajan´s Column.
            <br>Within this picture browser, the complete relief frieze of Trajan´s Column
            is presented, divided into individual scenes. Using a continuous graphic
            rendering or the scene search within the extended search engine, one has
            direct access to individual scenes and the associated pictures.</p>

        <p>In the 1980s and 1990s numerous photo campaigns by the Rome department
            took place in the sculpture collection of the Vatican Museums. The approximately
            6,000 pictures originated during these campaigns are digitized and entered
            in the online edition of the Vatican Catalogue by Walter Amelung in cooperation
            with the CoDArchLab since 2008.</p>
        <p>The online edition of the Amelung catalogue therefore exists of the links
            between the publication by Amelung existing in the Bookbrowser, the picture
            in the structured stock and the continuative literature.</p>
        
<h4><a con10t-search-query="Inventarbuch" con10t-search-facet="facet_kategorie:%22B%C3%BCcher%22">iDAI.Bookbrowser – Inventory registers of the DAI Rome photo archive </a></h4>

        <p>Until the late 1990s, inventory registers of the roman department´s photo
            collection were used to manage the institute´s own negatives, those acquired
            from other institutions or those obtained through donations. Generally
            there are two types of inventory books: books with no annual inventory
            figures from the period of 1885 – 1927 and inventory books with a chronological
            year value from 1928 to 1998. In cooperation with the CoDArchLab the registers
            were digitized and edited for online research. Access to the inventory
            books is now possible via the iDAI.Bookbrowser.</p>
        <p>By typing “Inventarbuch” and the desired year (e.g. 1929) in the look-up
            field on the welcome page of iDAI.Images Arachne, you reach a list of all
            inventory books sorted chronologically by year.</p>
        <p>As an additional feature for the picture research within the inventory
            books, we aim at showing the associated picture next to every negative
            number.</p>
        <p>The inventory books contain lists composed of nine columns including the
            following information (from left to right):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Photo No.</li>
            <li>Date of inventory</li>
            <li>Negative Format</li>
            <li>Photographer</li>
            <li>A short description of the object</li>
            <li>Repository at the time of admission</li>
            <li>Comments (e.g. dimensions, references etc.)</li>
            <li>Slide No.</li>
            <li>Negative No.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A missing negative number means that the photo archive of the DAI Rome
            department does not own the negative but has bought, inherited or respectively
            got it as a present.</p>
        
<h4><a con10t-page="imagegrid">Image Grid DAI Rome</a></h4>

        <p>The agglomeration of data in iDAI.Images Arachne over the last three years
            led to the insight that the manual labour of creating metadata for every
            image seemed impractical. Between 2002 an 2007 the number of images stored
            in iDAI.Images Arachne expanded from 50,000 to 200,000; our present stock
            of 800,000 images represents an increase of about 400%. In cooperation
            with the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) in Rome, the `Image Grid
            Project´ is seeking to solve these problems.</p>
        <p>With the `Image Grid Project´, we have automatically contextualized about
            400,000 images from the photo library of the DAI Rome. The images were
            digitized using old microfiche-slides and the only information was printed
            index. We have created a digital image database using OCR, in order to
            take the structure of this index and by using the negative numbers of the
            images. We have also linked images automatically with complex metadata,
            which are derived from digitized inventories, scientific reference works,
            images which are now already stored in iDAI.Images Arachne and other sources.
            Negative numbers are also used to connect images with OCR-texts (as in
            the iDAI.Bookbrowser or GoogleBooks), and by extracting knowledge from
            these books via text-mining we can connect new metadata to these digital
            images.</p>
