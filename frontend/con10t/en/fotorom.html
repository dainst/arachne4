            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>The Institute's collection of photographs dates back to the invention
                of photography itself. After the death of Walther Amelung in1927, the Institute
                inherited the collection that he had acquired for his own research purposes.
                From 1928 onwards, his successor, Ludwig Curtius, proceeded to systematically
                organize and expand the photo archive, thus giving it its current form.
                In the early 1930s, the Institute acquired a laboratory and established
                the post of an in-house photographer. As a result, the collection has grown
                considerably and extensive photo campaigns have given it varying content.
                Today the Roman photo archive is a unique research tool in archaeology.</p>

            <h3>Inventory and Focus</h3>

            <p>The photo archive consists of roughly 280,000 black-and-white photographs
                of which 200,000 are available as negatives. The collection is arranged
                according to the main categories within classical archaeological research:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ideal sculpture</b> (deities; mythological figures; non-mythological
                    statues; animals; mythical creatures/chimeras)
                </li>
                <li><b>Portrait sculpture</b> (Greek; Etruscan-Italic; Roman)</li>
                <li><b>Sarcophagi</b> (Greek; Etruscan; Republican-Early Imperial; Imperial;
                    Christian)
                </li>
                <li><b>Reliefs</b> (Greek; Greek/South Italian; Etruscan; Roman)</li>
                <li><b>Architectural sculpture</b> (Greece; Magna Graecia; Italy; support figures;
                    theatre decorations; architectural elements; historic reliefs)
                </li>
                <li><b>Inscriptions</b> (Greek; Latin)</li>
                <li><b>Stucco</b> (Etruscan; Roman)</li>
                <li><b>Fresco painting</b> (Etruscan; Italic/South Italian; Pompeian; Roman)</li>
                <li><b>Mosaics</b> (focus on: Italy; Roman provinces)</li>
                <li><b>Topography</b> (Greece; Italy; selected Roman provinces)</li>
                <li><b>Vases</b> (Proto-geometric; Geometric; Proto-Corinthian; Corinthian;
                    Eastern Greek; Western Greek; Lakonian; Chalcidian; Boeotian; Attic; Italic-Etruscan;
                    South Italian; Hellenistic; Roman)
                </li>

            <h3>The German Archaeological Institute (DAI) Rome photo archive in iDAI.Images Arachne</h3>


            <h4>Information about the identity numbers of the negatives</h4>

            <p>All negatives of the institute feature a negative number, i.e. inventory
                number composed of a four-digit date (year of the inventory, not the shot)
                and a continuous four-digit number. The abbreviation D-DAI Rom prior to
                the altogether eight-digit number brands the negative as belonging to the
                photo archive of the DAI Rome.</p>
            <p>Therefore the negative numbers are stated as follows:
                <br>Bsp.: D-DAI-ROM-1938.1329; D-DAI-ROM-2007.0023</p>
            <p>Negatives <strong>without</strong> date are part of the stock existing prior
                to 1928, e.g. D-DAI-ROM-00013).</p>
            <p>Within the stock of the photo archive are also negative numbers with inserted
                letter codes marking special groups of pictures within the collection (e.g.
                estates or bigger projects with regard to content).</p>
            <p>Following groups are currently available in iDAI.Images:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>D-DAI-ROM-<b>W</b>.93= Tatianer Warscher, topographical photographs of
                    Pompeii (tree-structured stock)
                </li>
                <li>D-DAI-ROM-96.<b>Vat</b>.1365= Vatican-project, collection of antique sculpture
                    (structured and tree-structured stock)
                </li>

                in order to immediately browse the desired object class. Alternatively
                one can search for the negative number of a picture via the meta search

            <p>Since May 2009, the growing digital stock of the photo archive of the
                DAI Rome is being managed via the tree-structured stock of iDAI.objects/Arachne.
                Here one can find the microfiches of the Rome Department, which are searchable through the <a con10t-page='fotoromcategories'>categories page</a>. This page further links to the Arachne where a facetted search is possible on the left side of the website. Different categories can be used together.

            <p>In the 1980s and 1990s numerous photo campaigns by the Rome department

                in the online edition of the Vatican Catalogue by Walter Amelung in cooperation

                – Inventory registers of the DAI Rome photo archive </a></h4>

            <p>Until the late 1990s, inventory registers of the roman department´s photo
                collection were used to manage the institute´s own negatives, those acquired
                from other institutions or those obtained through donations. Generally
                there are two types of inventory books: books with no annual inventory
                figures from the period of 1885 – 1927 and inventory books with a chronological
                year value from 1928 to 1998. In cooperation with the CoDArchLab the registers
                were digitized and edited for online research. Access to the inventory
                books is now possible via the iDAI.Bookbrowser.</p>
            <p>By typing “Inventarbuch” and the desired year (e.g. 1929) in the look-up
                field on the welcome page of iDAI.Images Arachne, you reach a list of all
                inventory books sorted chronologically by year.</p>
            <p>As an additional feature for the picture research within the inventory
                books, we aim at showing the associated picture next to every negative
                number.</p>
            <p>The inventory books contain lists composed of nine columns including the
                following information (from left to right):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Photo No.</li>
                <li>Date of inventory</li>
                <li>Negative Format</li>
                <li>Photographer</li>
                <li>A short description of the object</li>
                <li>Repository at the time of admission</li>
                <li>Comments (e.g. dimensions, references etc.)</li>
                <li>Slide No.</li>
                <li>Negative No.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A missing negative number means that the photo archive of the DAI Rome
                department does not own the negative but has bought, inherited or respectively
                got it as a present.</p>

            <h4><a con10t-page="imagegrid">Image Grid DAI Rome</a></h4>

            <p>The agglomeration of data in iDAI.Images Arachne over the last three years
                led to the insight that the manual labour of creating metadata for every
                image seemed impractical. Between 2002 an 2007 the number of images stored
                in iDAI.Images Arachne expanded from 50,000 to 200,000; our present stock
                of 800,000 images represents an increase of about 400%. In cooperation
                with the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) in Rome, the `Image Grid
                Project´ is seeking to solve these problems.</p>
            <p>With the `Image Grid Project´, we have automatically contextualized about
                400,000 images from the photo library of the DAI Rome. The images were
                digitized using old microfiche-slides and the only information was printed
                index. We have created a digital image database using OCR, in order to
                take the structure of this index and by using the negative numbers of the
                images. We have also linked images automatically with complex metadata,
                which are derived from digitized inventories, scientific reference works,
                images which are now already stored in iDAI.Images Arachne and other sources.
                Negative numbers are also used to connect images with OCR-texts (as in
                the iDAI.Bookbrowser or GoogleBooks), and by extracting knowledge from
                these books via text-mining we can connect new metadata to these digital
                images.</p>
