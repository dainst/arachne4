                <p>With the <a href ="https://arachne.dainst.org/project/rakob" target="_blank">bequest of Friedrich Rakob</a> (1931-2007), the DAI is making one of its most important and most extensive holdings on North Tunisian archaeology accessible to the public. The materials from more than 35 years of research work are housed in the DAI’s archives in Rome. 
                Work began in 2015 by drawing up a systematic inventory of the holding and organising it, based on Rakob’s notes. The archival material consists mainly of photographs – approximately 63,000 photographic negatives, slides and contact prints – and around 190 folders and crates containing excavation diaries, drawings, plans and other documents (such as correspondence, preliminary reports and the texts of speeches).</p> 
                
                <p>The drawings (find drawings, plans, etc.) have already been digitised within the framework of the DFG-funded project <a href ="https://arachne.dainst.org/project/handzeichnungen" target="_blank">The Antiquity in Drawing, Plan and Architectural Survey: Primary Documentation of the 19th and 20th centuries at the German Archaeological Institute in Rome.</a> and can be viewed within the online catalogue of the <a href ="https://arachne.dainst.org/catalog/215/552915" target="_blank">"Architect's archive"</a>, which can also be accessed in iDAI.objects/Arachne.</p> 

                <p>The materials relating to Rakob’s projects are being gradually digitised and indexed. To date, the majority of the photographic material, excavation diaries and drawings from Rakob’s bequest have been digitised. This undertaking began with the major excavations in Carthage and Chimtou, which were his most important projects.

                <font color=#336699><h3 id="Deichmann">Friedrich Wilhelm Deichmann</h3></font>

                Friedrich Wilhelm Deichmann (1909-1993) was an archaeologist and art historian who specialised in Byzantine architecture and in particular church architecture and furnishings. His research in North Africa took him to Libya, where he examined the urban structure of Sabratha and Tripoli, and to Tunisia and Algeria, where he studied early Christian sarcophagi. It is estimated that Deichmann’s bequest includes more than 9,500 photographic negatives.

                Christa von Hees-Landwehr (†2012) worked on Roman sculpture in the Archaeological Museum of Cherchell (Algeria) and Roman copies of Greek statues in Baiae. She published her extensive findings in a four-volume catalogue. Her bequest includes approximately 1,700 photographic negatives and roughly the same number of contact prints of the sculptures. <p>&nbsp;</p>

                Josef Röder (1914-1974) specialised in ancient quarries and marble extraction in the Mediterranean. In the course of his research, he travelled to Tunisia (in particular Chimtou and the Carthage area) and Algeria (Lambaesis, Orousse, Chenoua and Suhut/Synnada) in the 1950s and 1960s. His bequest includes approximately 9,000 photographic negatives and slides, which were presented to the Research Archive for Ancient Sculpture in the Archaeological Institute of the University of Cologne in 2008.
