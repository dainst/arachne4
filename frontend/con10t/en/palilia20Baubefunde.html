        <p>The catalogue of architectural remains presents especially archaeological
            records to the castra praetoria, the castra peregrina and to the castra
            nova equitum singularium. The remained troops' accommodations are poorly
            preserved or only represented by a few entries. It's because in many cases
            there is no excavation report or they were not accessible. The catalogue
            considers the finds and findings which originate from the area of each
            camp as well as from the immediate surroundings.</p>
        <p>The surrounding defence of the castra praetoria is only described accurately,
            when peculiarities were discovered during the object's survey and if not
            mentioned in the detailed description of Lucos Cozza (Cozza, Mura). The
            altitudes given in the catalogue texts refer to the respective run level
            at the time of excavation. The original run level often can not be reconstructed
            to an absolute height because the natural course of the terrain within
            the camp is uncertain and the referenced altitudes as well as the calculated
            daily heights are lacking.</p>
        <p>The associated finds are attached to the relevant archaeological records.</p>
        <p>The catalog numbers follow a fixed numbering scheme, which is composed
            of an abbreviation for the particular camp and of two numbers separated
            by a dot (eg CP 1.14). The first number represents the feature category
            (1 = surrounding defense), the second for the actual finding (14 = finding).
            In this way the feature numbers can be clearly distinguished from the catalog
            numbers of the grave monuments.</p>
        <p>Abbreviation of urban roman camps:
            <br>CP = castra praetoria
            <br>CPE = castra peregrina
            <br>CPES = castra priora equitum singularium
            <br>CNES = castra nova equitum singularium
            <br>SCV = stationes cohortium vigilum
            <br>ECV = excubitoria cohortium vigilum</p>
        <p>Categories of findings:
            <br>1 = Surrounding defence
            <br>2 = Building
            <br>3 = Infrastructure
            <br>4 = Not determinable findings
            <br>5 = Findings with no longer known exact location
            <br>6 = Findings surrounding the camp</p>

        <p>All records of the catalogue are currently available via the 'Metasearch'
            as well as via the 'Extended search'. The links of the catalogues to the
            respective records are presently in process.</p>
