  <p>Catalogue of the Ancient Sculptures in the Fasanerie Castle (Adolphseck)
  near Fulda.</p>

  <p>Among furniture, porcelain and paintings, Fasanerie Castle (Adolphseck) in
  Eichenzell near Fulda also features a collection of Greco-Roman sculpture,
  which was assembled by Landgrave Philipp of Hesse (1896-1980). It had been
  housed in the Landgrave-Museum in Kassel since 1935. After this was destroyed
  during the war, it was transferred to the Fasanerie Castle, its current
  residence, in 1951. Here it is under the supervision of the “Hessische
  Hausstiftung”. The Greek vases were published in two volumes of the Corpus
  Vasorum Antiquorum while the 57 portraits appeared in a catalogue in 1957.
  The left-over 88 marble and limestone sculptures however tend to be
  side-lined by science, even though it is one of the few private collections
  in Germany that have survived the 2nd World War undamaged and was not merged
  into another museum stock. Aside from the colossal head of a cult statue from
  the early 5th cent. BC and attic grave reliefs, the inventory also holds
  Roman copies of works from the 4th cent. BC and the Hellenistic period. There
  are fragments of Roman sarcophagi and historic reliefs as well as interior
  artefacts of the Roman Imperial era and a series of partly well kept
  buildings in architectural probes, which can be allocated to Rome. The
  project aims to make the holdings of one of the most significant private
  collections of Greek and Roman sculpture in Germany available to science by
  photographically documenting and scientifically processing them. The study of
  the genesis of a private collection and of the related special form of
  interest in antiquity during the 20th century will be of concern of
  collector's history.</p>
