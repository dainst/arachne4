            <p>Palilia volume 20 is about the military in the city of Rome in all its
                aspects, especially the multiple layers of its cultural image, its effect
                on the urban population, and its significance for civilian life in the
                capital. In the Republican period Rome was considered a "demilitarised"
                zone. Under Augustus soldiers were stationed in the imperial capital for
                the first time, marking a decisive turning point between Republic and
                Principate. Between 10,000 and 40,000 soldiers lived and worked in Imperial
                Rome and constituted an important part of the civic culture of the
                city.</p>
            <p>This book is the first comprehensive evaluation of the written,
                archaeological and iconographic sources for the military in Rome and the
                life and function of the Roman soldier in the capital.</p>
            <p>The basis of archeological material for the study, like the
                architectural remains of the troops' accommodations <a con10t-page=
                                                                               "palilia20Baubefunde">(to the
                    catalogue)</a> as well as the grave monuments
                of soldiers and veterans <a con10t-page="palilia20Grabdenkmaeler">(to the
                    catalogue)</a>, was recorded and structured using the Arachne-database.
                Here, in addition to the printed work, all of the archaeological material
                can be recorded, found and according to the user's criteria it can be also
                re-sorted and exported by using both the catalogue's index of contents and
                via the ›Metasearch‹ as well as the ›Advanced Search‹. Arachne as a dynamic
                platform offers also the author the opportunity to add information to known
                pieces but also to missing pieces that became known after the publication
                of the book. The author is grateful for information, additions and
                corrections.</p>
