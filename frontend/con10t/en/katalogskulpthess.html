    <p>In the Department of Archaeology of the Aristotle University of
    Thessaloniki a research group of PhD candidates and graduate students was
    formed in 1991 under the supervision of Professors G. Despinis, Th.
    Stefanidou- Tiveriou and Emm. Boutiras. The group has been working since
    then on the research project of development of the photographic archive of
    sculptures kept in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. The
    Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki keeps sculptures dating from the
    archaic to the late imperial period and found mainly in the area from
    various regions of Macedonia and Thrace. This archive is used for the
    publication of the sculptures of the Museum. Until today only the first
    volume has been published: G. Despinis, Th. Stefanidou- Tiveriou, Emm.
    Boutiras, List of sculptures of the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki
    (1997). The second volume in which a bigger number of writers participate
    is in press, while the material that will constitute the third volume of
    series has already been collected. The archive holds currently over 3.200
    photographs.</p>
    <p>Arachne is used to mirror that archive and to update it with further
    volumes.</p>
