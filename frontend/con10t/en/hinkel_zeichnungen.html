                Part of the material collected by Friedrich W. Hinkel during his long-lasting research endeavors in the
                Sudan are the over 4.000 (mostly hand-drawn) drawings, which illustrate all aspects of the
                archaeological heritage of the Sudan. Apart from architectural drawings and copies of older
                illustrations made by Hinkel the archive also contains hand-drawn map sheets for the “The Archaeological
                Map of the Sudan“ as well as illustrations of archaeological objects.
                Some drawing, such as illustrations of the reliefs of the pyramids of Meroe, were made by draftsmen
                hired by Dr. Hinkel according to his specifications.

            <p>
                In the course of digitization all drawings were registered and their subject matter identified. Drawings
                showing the same or similar content, such as the so called pattern books featuring all pyramids of
                Meroe, were integrated into the iDAI.Bookbrowser, while single sheets were structured geographically
                according to the AMS-system and entered into iDAI.objects. The connection between iDAI.objects and the
                iDAI.gazetteer allows for a systematic search for information regarding specific sites and buildings.

                The copyright for all drawings in the archive of Friedrich W. Hinkel rests (unless stated otherwise)
                with the DAI.
