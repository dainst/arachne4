  <p>The Plaster Cast Collection of the Academic Art Museum of the University
  of Bonn is gradually being photographically documented and transferred into
  Arachne since 1998. That way the technical emphases of the Archaeological
  Institutes of Cologne and Bonn can be brought closer together by two
  facilities that are marked by the Roman and Greek art in a very significant
  way: The Plaster Cast Collection of Bonn and the CoDArchLab in Cologne. The
  Plaster Cast Collection of Bonn is one of the greatest in Europe, whereas the
  CoDArchLab possesses the greatest specialized photo-collection in the realm
  of ancient sculpture.</p>

  <p>Within the province of Greek art, archaeological research and teaching
  would gain access to an important resource from the University of Bonn.</p>

  <p>The desired collimation does not only combine the images and the data of
  Greek and Roman sculpture, the media also complement each other and are used
  as basic tools for educational purposes along with photographs. Although
  casts have the advantage of being three-dimensional physical copies, it is a
  lot easier to collect photographs, thus permitting a higher density for
  documentation and creating comparative rows. Often it is easier to take
  pictures of the essential side- and back view of a copy of a monument than
  the original. Plaster casts are able to reflect the round plastic form of an
  antique monument more accurately than photographs, since the shading is
  difficult to calculate. Illuminated and photographed under consistent
  circumstances, they often provide valuable information concerning certain
  research problems. Moreover, comparing them amongst themselves may offer more
  accurate relations than by heterogeneous photographs. Therefore it is most
  desirable to exploit both media in their complex form with their different
  complimentary characteristics for teaching.</p>
