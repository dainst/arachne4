            <p>Josef Röder, who died in 1974, spent his lifetime examining quarries and
                digging techniques as well as the itinerary and trade routes for stone
                material in the ancient Roman Empire. One of his intentions was to
                investigate the mining of marble in the whole Mediterranean area. His quest
                was funded by the DAI (German Archaeological Institute) as well as the DFG
                (German Research Foundation) (ancient marble quarries in
                Chemtou/Simitthus).</p>
            <p>The CoDArchlab received the scholarly bequest of Josef Röder in summer
                2008 as slides stored in three wooden boxes. The pictures of Josef Röder's
                travels were soon imported into the Arachne database. The pictures document
                the trips he made to Split (Croatia), Chemtou and Carthage (Tunesia), Afyon
                and Istanbul (Turkey), Lambaesis, Orousse, Chenoua and Suhut/Synnada
                (Algeria), Wadi Hammamat (Egypt), Bretagne (France), Stonehenge (Great
                Britain), Elba (Italy) and Greek sites such as Kapsala and Styra (Euboea),
                Karystos (Myloi), Athens, Larissa (Thessaly) and Krokeia (Laconia) in the
                50s and 60s.</p>
            <p>Among other things the Arachne database contains material samples
                (single objects) of various kinds of rock, for example marble from Synnada
                and granite from Mons Claudius. Records of buildings such as the Mausoleum
                of the Emperor Diocletian in Split are also at hand. Divers kinds of rock
                were imported for this building and this import as well as the appropriate
                trade-routes were part of Josef Röder's main research.</p>
            <p>Records of the topography of for example marble storage facilities
                (Afyon), stone quarries (Lambaesis), slope-disintegration (Kapsala) or
                rocky regions (Elba) have also been made accesible in Arachne. These
                datasets are labeled with the note “Nachlass Josef Röder” in the literature
                input field.</p>
