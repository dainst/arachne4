            <p>Until the late 1990s inventory registers of the roman department's photo
                collection were used to manage the institute's own negatives, those
                acquired from other institutions or those obtained through donations.
                Generally there are two types of inventory books: books with no annual
                inventory figures from the period of 1885 - 1927 and inventory books with a
                chronological year value from 1928 to 1998. Additionally, in the course of
                the project funded by the Volkswagen Foundation three separate inventory
                books were created as well as one register for the image archive of Tatjana
                Warscher.</p>
            <p>The inventory books contains lists composed of nine columns which
                include the following information (from left to right):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Photo No.</li>
                <li>Date of Inventory</li>
                <li>Negative Format</li>
                <li>Photographer</li>
                <li>a short description of the object</li>
                <li>Repository at the time of admission</li>
                <li>Comments (e.g. dimensions, references, etc.)</li>
                <li>Slide No.</li>
                <li>Negative No.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The entire stock of the institution's inventory registers was digitized
                in recent years and made accessible in the database Arachne for online
                research in collaboration with the Cologne Digital Archaeology Laboratory.
                The iDAI.Bookbrowser of Arachne can now used to access the entire inventory
                of the photo collection in Rome. <a con10t-search-catalog="">Here</a> all
                inventory books can be retrieved in chronological order. Unique inventory
                books can be found through a search for "Inventarbuch" plus the year or -
                in the case of the registers without assigned year - with a query for the
                first and the last negative number of the volume (e.g. "Inventarbuch 1956"
                or "Inventarbuch 1076 1500"). Individual negative numbers can also be used
                to display the corresponding inventory book page (e.g. "76.2006").</p>
            <p>Besides the ability to browse the registers the iDAI.Bookbrowser also
                offers the possibility to see digital images from the stock photo library
                of the DAI Rome if they have already been digitised.
