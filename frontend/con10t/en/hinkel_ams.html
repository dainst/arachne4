                The alphanumeric codification of archaeological sites used in Hinkel's publication series “The
                Archaeological Map of the Sudan“ is largely based on the International Map of the World, founded in
                1913. The International Map of the World consists of maps in the scale of 1:1.000.000, each of which
                holding an alphanumeric designation based on their location. Map sheets depicting areas in the northern
                hemisphere carry the identification N as well as a designation referring to their respective geographic
                latitude (a letter) and longitude (a two-digit number). The Sudan (including the Republic of South
                Sudan) is depicted in the map sheets ranging from NF-34 to NA-36 (see Fig. 1). In addition to these
                standardized designations used since the 1960s, the archive of Friedrich W. Hinkel also contains
                material referring to an older system in which the alphanumeric code was replaced by a sequence of
                numbers with up to three digits (see Fig. 1).

                Every 1:1.000.000 map sheet of the International Map of the World is divided into 16 maps in the scale
                of 1:250.000, named A to P. This classification of the International Map of the World has been used for
                the registration of sites by the Sudan Antiquities Service since the early 20th century and was later
                refined by Friedrich Wilhelm Hinkel by adding three additional layers of geographic classification. The
                map sheets with a scale of 1:250.000 were thus divided into 24 rectangles representing a longitude of
                15' numbered 1 to 24 (i.e. Fig. 2). Each of these rectangles where then divided into 25 units named A to
                Y representing a longitude of 3'.

                Due to this refinement of the system and the resulting AMS-numbers it is possible to locate
                archaeological sites in the Sudan within an area of ca. 5 by 5 km using only the alphanumeric
                designation as a reference. The system also allows for the registration for less securely located sites
                and findings based on a more general description of their original location.
