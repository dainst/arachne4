  <p>As a partner of the German Archaeological Institute, the CoDArchLab
  cooperates with the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/" target=
  "_blank">Perseus Digital Library</a> at Tufts University to combine the
  digital collections of classical studies of both institutions. Thus one of
  the most comprehensive and free online collections of Greek and Roman
  antiquity will be available for public and scientific use. The basis of the
  Hellespont project is the combination of text and object data using the
  metadata format CIDOC CRM. The <a href=
  "http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/codarchlab/cidoc-mapping/index.php?category=cidoc&amp;call=browser&amp;typ=dyn"
  target="_blank">CRM mapping of the Arachne database</a> is part of other
  projects of the CoDArchLab carried out at the moment. The use of CIDOC CRM to
  map ancient text content in order to build a bridge to other types of sources
  is a methodological innovation. The material world in Thucydides'
  <i>Pentecontaetia</i> (Thuc. 1,89 to 1,118) is the chosen starting point for
  the integration of both data sets; other parts of the text will follow at a
  later stage.<a href="./hellespont_img/Thuc1.png"><img width="275" src=
  "./hellespont_img/Thuc1klein.png"></a></p>

  <p>One task of the project consists in manually identifying entities
  representing categories in the archaeological and textual evidence (e.g.
  built spaces, topography, individual persons, populations) within the whole
  text of Thucydides’ <i>Pentecontaetia</i>. These entities will be annotated
  according to the TEI guidelines, so as to enrich the text simultaneously with
  historical background information.</p>

  <p>Event annotation is also performed simultaneously, taking as a basis the
  mainly discussed historical events of the text in modern research literature.
  At this level of analysis, the word strings annotated with TEI markup
  represent historical events according to the description of the ancient
  author, which finally ended in the political and military conflict between
  Athens and Sparta (Peloponnesian War). In the following part of the project,
  the main content of Thucydides' text will be mapped using the event-based
  CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model with reference to these word strings.</p>

  <p>At the same time, supported by a <a href=
  "http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=Fellowships&amp;bdc=12&amp;mn=0" target=
  "_blank">CHS/DAI joint fellowship</a>, the narrative and discursive structure
  of the text, as well as all its relevant linguistic features, are also being
  annotated. One of the goals of the linguistic annotation is to provide a more
  solid background for the aforementioned task of event identification. The
  linguistic annotation of Thucydides' Histories is performed according to the
  guidelines of the <a href="http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/"
  target="_blank">Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank</a>, which provide a
  word-by-word analysis of the morphological and syntactical features of the
  text. A further level of linguistic analysis, namely the so-called
  “tectogrammatical annotation” on semantic and pragmatic aspects which are
  necessary to understand the event structure of a text, will be tested
  following the model of the <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/" target=
  "_blank">Prague Dependency Treebank</a>.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, to open up the broader historical context of the related
  sources, we explore the idea of a VRE combining archaeological and
  philological data with secondary research literature and in particular
  journal articles, that will be collected in an automized way. This part of
  the research is carried out in the context of a PhD project at the <a href=
  "http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh" target="_blank">Department of
  Digital Humanities at King's College</a> (formerly the Centre for Computing
  in the Humanities) since January 2011 and in close cooperation with the
  Thucydides Project at the CoDArchLab.</p>

  <p>The combination of all available sources on a historical topic by means of
  a single Virtual Research Environment (VRE) will open up new perspectives and
  modes of research of the ancient greek and roman world.</p>

  <p>Starting from October 2010, the project has been funded for three years by
  the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/news/archive/201007200.html" target=
  "_blank">NEH / DFG Bilateral Digital Humanities Program 'Enriching Digital
  Collections'</a> that offers support for cooperations between U.S. and German
  scientists to develop research-related digitization projects for the
  humanities. Each of these projects will be jointly run by an American and a
  German institution.</p><img width="150" src=
