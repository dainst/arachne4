    <h1>The Stendal Collection of Paintings and Drawings</h1>

    <p><strong>Prof. Dr. Max Kunze</strong></p>

    <p>The collections of the Winckelmann-Society and the Winckelmann-Museum in
    Stendal (print graphics, autographs, paintings)</p>

    <p>The Winckelmann-Collection in Arachne is still in progress. The object
    is to make the holdings of the museum available for science. This concerns
    the common object data as well as the image-material, which enables
    uncomplicated photo orders and also a lasting backup of the photo holdings
    in print quality. Due to the special character of the Stendal Museum, which
    is dedicated to the founder of archaeology and art history, the collection
    holdings appear very heterogeneous and can well be subsumed under the
    heading “Reception of Antique and Winckelmann”. The Winckelmann-Society has
    strived to add to the inventory since 1940 and is being assisted by the
    Museum since 1955. The inventory holds drawings, paintings, sculpture,
    antiques, coins and portrait medals as well as autographs and etchings. The
    focus is laid on the few autographs of J. J. Winckelmann, the first
    editions and early prints of his works, as well as the scholar’s portraits.
    The Arachne-database currently holds paintings and drawings of Winckelmann.
    The graphic section containing etchings of antiques as well as views of
    Italy especially from the 18th century (Sadeler, Piranesi, Vasi, Rossini
    etc.) is also available in the Arachne-database. The etchings of
    archaeological and antiquarian literature used by Winckelmann are available
    as well, via the book-browser of Arachne. Of great interest for the
    archaeological research in the Vesuv-cities are the more than 200
    aquarelles of the Presuhn collection showing the excavations from 1874 to
    1881. A small collection of antiquities consisting above all of Greek
    vases, terracottas, bronzes, everyday objects of various categories, coins
    and only a few sculptures, serves to illuminate Winckelmann's research
    topic. The collection is already published and will be merged into Arachne
    shortly. More collection complexes are in progress.</p>
