				<p>The <b>Palatine</b>as the 'cradle' of Rome aroused the interest of antiquarians, excavators and artists early on. This research project 
                focuses on how the challenge of visually documenting and reconstructing the Palatine's ancient buildings and numerous finds, which techniques
                 and methods were used and how the resulting images were used to create and pass on knowledge.</p>

				<p>The <b>project</b> deals with the handling of pictorial documentation in archaeological research processes on the basis of a larger topographical complex.
                The time frame is broad and ranges from the first plans and views of the Palatine in the early modern period to current computer-aided methods of image 
                production. Due to the long period of investigation, changes and disruptions in the images come to light and enable an analysis of the factors responsible for this. 
                In addition, the long-term perspective of the project also makes it possible to examine the influence of earlier images on the visualizations created after them, 
                thus answering the question of how image conventions emerge, change and have a lasting impact on research questions and results. In this way, the project not only 
                generates new information on the Palatine and its research history, but also makes a fundamental contribution to the practice of pictorial documentation and reconstruction 
                as practices of knowledge production in archaeology.</p>

				<p>Parallel to the analytical monograph, a geoinformation system for the visualization history of the Palatine ("PalatinGIS") is being set up within <a href="https://idai.world/">idai.world</a>
                as a central <b>analysis tool</b>. It enables the comprehensible comparison and evaluation of the extensive data collection already available (approx. 1,700 digitized 
                images) from private and institutional archives. The GIS will be made accessible in accordance with the FAIR principles and will be freely available for further
                research following the project. In the course of its development, there will also be an opportunity to critically reflect on the heuristic added value of digital
                data processing.</p>

				<p>The <b>Palatine geoinformation system ("PalatinGIS")<b> is being created and will grow successively over the course of the project. In chronological order
                and analogous to the monograph currently in progress, images from research into the Palatine from the early modern period (around 1500) to the age of 
                digitization will be enriched with information and fed into <a href="https://arachne.dainst.org/">iDAI.objects</a> in the form of object entries. Each of these entries is mapped in a chronological
                layer in <a href="https://geoserver.dainst.org/#/">iDAI.geoserver</a>. A layer is a georeferenced map of the Palatine that was created not too long after the image was taken. The entries in Objects can 
                be searched (<a href="https://arachne.dainst.org/info/faq">https://arachne.dainst.org/info/faq</a>) according to various criteria (object depicted, date, artist, technique, literature, etc.). A reciprocal 
                linking of the entries - from the object entry in iDAI.objects to the corresponding layer in iDAI.geoserver and back - enables comprehensive research that 
                facilitates the accessibility and comparability of the images with regard to various aspects that were investigated in more detail in the project. For a better 
                overview, in addition to access to the entire catalogue, two further catalogues will be created containing material from specific time periods and from specific 
                building complexes of the Palatine (chronological and topographical catalogue).</p>
